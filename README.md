Objective: To predict the likelihood of stroke occurrence based on user-provided data using machine learning models.

Data Preprocessing:

Removed null and duplicate values.
Cleaned and standardized the dataset for consistency.
Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to derive meaningful insights from each column in relation to stroke occurrence.
Conducted correlation analysis to identify significant variables affecting stroke risk.

Modeling:

Built and trained models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest.
Evaluated model performance based on accuracy and selected the best-performing model for stroke prediction.
Used the trained model to predict stroke likelihood based on user input data.

Tools & Techniques:

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
Data Cleaning and Preparation
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Machine Learning: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest
